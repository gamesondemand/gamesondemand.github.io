  questions:
  - question: >
      Are start times every 2 hours like last year? Is it 10am, 12pm, 2pm, 4pm, 6pm, 8pm, 10pm?
    answer: >
      Yes, with a few adjustments. See <a href="/">our schedule for start times</a>.
  - question: >
      When should I arrive for a time slot?
    answer: >
      I would be there at least 5 minutes in advance.
      We will begin boarding people promptly on the hour.
  - question: >
      If signups start at the time of the slot, when do you expect games to start?
      Say a slot starts at 12pm, does that mean games actually start at 12:15pm?
    answer:  >
      If the slot starts at 2pm, we will start boarding at 2pm. Not 1:45pm as previous years.
      It also means that games are going to run a bit later than previous years (instead of ending at 1:45pm I would expect them to wrap up at 1:55pm)﻿
  - question: >
      Why are there no games being run at 8pm and 10pm on Thursday?
    answer: >
      Thursday evening we are closing down for a bit of last minute GM and Host training and to play amongst ourselves.
      This is an all volunteer effort and we are going to take a bit of time to celebrate!
- name: Boarding Passes
  dom_id: boarding-passes
  questions:
  - question: >
      What is this about boarding passes?
    answer: >
      There are a lot of people that come to Games on Demand.
      Think of the boarding pass as one of those buzzers that you get at a restaurant.
      When your boarding pass group is called, you can come up and choose a game to play.
  - question: >
      When can I get a boarding pass?﻿
    answer: >
      You can get a boarding pass at anytime leading up to the start time.
      In the minutes leading up to 2pm there will be a loud "Last call for 2pm boarding passes"
      Then at 2pm boarding begins.
  - question: >
      It sounds like I can get a boarding pass anytime within 2 hour before the time I want to play?
      So if I want to play a game at 12pm, I can pick up a pass anytime between 10am and 12pm.
      Is this correct?﻿
    answer: Yes.
  - question: >
      If I am playing a game in say, the 12-4 slot, will a Host come by my table to see if anyone at my table would like a boarding pass for the next slot (4-8 or 4-6)?
    answer: >
      If you are in a 4 hour game, when the host comes around you will be able to get a boarding pass for your next immediately available slot (eg 4pm boarding).
  - question: >
      Will I keep my boarding pass for the entirity of GenCon?
    answer: >
      No. As part of the boarding process, you'll turn in your boarding pass.

  questions:
  - question: >
      Will I know what games are available before start time?
      If so, starting when and where? ﻿
    answer: Yes. See <a href="/">our schedule for start times</a>.
  - question: >
      I heard something about LARPs! Is this true?
    answer: >
      Yes there will be LARPs at Games on Demand.
- name: Groups
  dom_id: groups
  questions:
  - question: >
      What if I come with a spouse or child...can we signup for games together?
      If yes, does this mean we'd get the same type of boarding pass (say, "dragon") and simply wait for our type to be called? ﻿
  - question: >
      When will you collect my generic ticket?
    answer: >
      A host will collect your generic ticket(s) after you have sat down at the table and your game is running.

  dom_id: miscellany
  questions:
  - question: >
      Last year there was sometimes confusion over what was a 2 hour game vs. 4 hour game.
      I think because the slots are every 2 hours that led some people to believe all games were 2 hours long.
      I sat at a table where 3 players knew they signed up for a 4 hour game and 1 player thought it was a 2 hour game.
      There are instances where this sort of thing will happen no matter what.
    answer: >
      The plan is to have separate boarding tables for signing up 2 hour and 4 hour slots.
      You'll need to choose before hand how long you are in for.
      Now, if you want to jump to the other table that's fine.
      But at least you'll be making that decision.﻿
  - question: >
      How do GMs get sorted?
      I'm running my game from 12-2 and want to play from 2-4, but ... I'm running my game from 12-2!﻿
    answer: >
      One of the chores for the hosts as they are collecting generic tickets and statistics is to ask if anyone needs a boarding pass for the next session.﻿
  - question: >
      What if there is only 1 specific game I want to play with 1 specific GM?
      This sounds outside the scope of Games On Demand but I know someone will ask so I'm asking!
    answer: >
      If there is that one game with that one GM that you really want to run, I would suggest that you reach out to that GM and coordinate something outside of Games on Demand.
  - question: >
      One thing that came up last year was the multiple warnings that the times were almost up were distracting in the middle of the 4 hour slots.
      Could we have the 2 and 4 hour tables a bit apart so the warnings and the movement won't be distracting?
    tentative_answer: >
       We may see about offloading the timing to the GMs. Many people have phones and timers. And certainly someone at a table could help be the time keeper. Good question!﻿
    answer: >
      @TODO
      Hosts will not be giving a warning about time.
  - question: >
      How are you handling people with health conditions?
      Does any aspect of this involve moving about: if so, are people who aren't as physically mobile at a disadvantage?
    answer: >
      @TODO
  - question: >
      Are you boarding those who need assistance first?﻿
    tentative_answer: >
      We will have a call before the lottery to seat those that need assistance. This may actually happen a bit before the hour (speed of seating is another desired goal so we are balancing that concern as well).
    answer: >
      @TODO
  - question: >
      I want to play in a game at 2pm, but I have an obligation at 4pm.
      Since Games on Demand says it ends at 3:55pm, should I avoid Games on Demand for that time?
    answer: >
      No!
      Make sure to communicate up front to your GM if you have a hard stop time.
      You are in charge of your time.
      We are here to help you optimize it!﻿
  - question: >
      What about people with hearing difficulties? How will they know about the last call for tickets?﻿
    tentative_answer: >
      We will have signage and do our best to use them. Holding up signs. I will need to task someone on what our signage options are.
      At a minimum, we should have a poster that we can hold up saying "Last call to get your boarding pass!"
      We are also making a website to convey the procedures. This also is not ideal for those without tech, but we will have a few printouts.﻿
    answer: >
      @TODO
  - question: >
      What is the cost to play a game at Games on Demand?
    answer: >
      To play in a 2 hour game, you will need 1 generic ticket (or a ticket from another event).
      For a 4 hour game you will need 2 tickets.
  - question: >
      If I GM/facilitate a game do I have to pay?
    answer: >
      No. You get a free play. After all you are helping us out!
  - question: >
      Is the boarding pass only good for that time slot?
    answer: >
      No. A boarding pass is good for any future time slot.
  - question: >
      If its good for any future timeslot what is preventing me from collecting one of each group?
    answer: >
      Human decency.
  - question: >
      What is the wait time for getting a boarding pass?
    answer: >
      Getting a boarding pass should be a quick thing.
      No more than 5 minutes of waiting.
  - question: >
      Can I bring my group to play a game with?
      For example I have 4-6 people and we all want to experience a new game together.
      Can we do this?
      Do we have a list of games to pick from?
      If there is a certain game we are interested in will we be able to sign up for them?
    answer: >
      To have a chance at playing together, you will need to have each of your friends grab a like numbered boarding pass.
      But there will be challenges with larger groups.
      Games and their slots are chosen on a first come first serve basis.
      This can make it very challenging to get 6 people to the same table.
      So be open about trying new games.

      Who can I bribe to get into the game I want?
    answer: >
      Bribes to get to play the game you want? There will be none of that.﻿
