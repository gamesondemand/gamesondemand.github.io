- question: >
    Are start times every 2 hours like last year? Is it 10am, 12pm, 2pm, 4pm, 6pm, 8pm, 10pm?
  answer: >
    Yes. See <a href="/">our schedule for start times</a>.
- question: >
    It sounds like I can get a boarding pass anytime within 2 hour before the time I want to play?
    So if I want to play a game at 12pm, I can pick up a pass anytime between 10am and 12pm.
    Is this correct?﻿
  answer: Yes.
- question: >
    Will I know what games are available before start time?
    If so, starting when and where? ﻿
  answer: Yes. See <a href="/">our schedule for start times</a>.
- question: >
    What if I come with a spouse or child...can we signup for games together?
    If yes, does this mean we'd get the same type of boarding pass (say, "dragon") and simply wait for our type to be called? ﻿
- question: >
    If signups start at the time of the slot, when do you expect games to start?
    Say a slot starts at 12pm, does that mean games actually start at 12:15pm?
  answer:  >
    If the slot starts at 2pm, we will start boarding at 2pm. Not 1:45pm as previous years.
    It also means that games are going to run a bit later than previous years (instead of ending at 1:45pm I would expect them to wrap up at 1:55pm)﻿
- question: >
    Who can I bribe to get into the game I want?
  answer: >
    Bribes to get to play the game you want? There will be none of that.﻿
- question: >
    I heard something about LARPs! Is this true?
  answer: >
    Yes there will be LARPs at Games on Demand.
- question: >
    When will you collect my generic ticket?
  answer: >
    A host will collect your generic ticket(s) after you have sat down at the table and your game is running.
- question: >
    When can I get a boarding pass?﻿
  answer: >
    You can get a boarding pass at anytime leading up to the start time.
    In the minutes leading up to 2pm there will be a loud "Last call for 2pm boarding passes"
    Then at 2pm boarding begins.
- question: >
    Last year there was sometimes confusion over what was a 2 hour game vs. 4 hour game.
    I think because the slots are every 2 hours that led some people to believe all games were 2 hours long.
    I sat at a table where 3 players knew they signed up for a 4 hour game and 1 player thought it was a 2 hour game.
    There are instances where this sort of thing will happen no matter what.
  answer: >
    The plan is to have separate boarding tables for signing up 2 hour and 4 hour slots.
    You'll need to choose before hand how long you are in for.
    Now, if you want to jump to the other table that's fine.
    But at least you'll be making that decision.﻿
- question: >
    What is Thursday evening? 8pm?
  answer: >
    Thursday evening we are closing down for a bit of last minute GM and Host training and to play amongst ourselves.
    This is an all volunteer effort and we are going to take a bit of time to celebrate!
- question: >
    How do GMs get sorted?
    I'm running my game from 12-2 and want to play from 2-4, but ... I'm running my game from 12-2!﻿
  answer: >
    One of the chores for the hosts as they are collecting generic tickets and statistics is to ask if anyone needs a boarding pass for the next session.﻿
- question: >
    What if there is only 1 specific game I want to play with 1 specific GM?
    This sounds outside the scope of Games On Demand but I know someone will ask so I'm asking!
  answer: >
    If there is that one game with that one GM that you really want to run, I would suggest that you reach out to that GM and coordinate something outside of Games on Demand.
- question: >
    One thing that came up last year was the multiple warnings that the times were almost up were distracting in the middle of the 4 hour slots.
    Could we have the 2 and 4 hour tables a bit apart so the warnings and the movement won't be distracting?
  tentative_answer: >
     We may see about offloading the timing to the GMs. Many people have phones and timers. And certainly someone at a table could help be the time keeper. Good question!﻿
  answer: >
    @TODO
    Hosts will not be giving a warning about time.
- question: >
    If I am playing a game in say, the 12-4 slot, will a Host come by my table to see if anyone at my table would like a boarding pass for the next slot (4-8 or 4-6)?
  answer: >
    If you are in a 4 hour game, when the host comes around you will be able to get a boarding pass for your next immediately available slot (eg 4pm boarding).
- question: >
    How are you handling people with health conditions?
    Does any aspect of this involve moving about: if so, are people who aren't as physically mobile at a disadvantage?
  answer: >
    @TODO
- question: >
    Are you boarding those who need assistance first?﻿
  tentative_answer: >
    We will have a call before the lottery to seat those that need assistance. This may actually happen a bit before the hour (speed of seating is another desired goal so we are balancing that concern as well).
  answer: >

- question: >
    I want to play in a game at 2pm, but I have an obligation at 4pm.
    Since Games on Demand says it ends at 3:55pm, should I avoid Games on Demand for that time?
  answer: >
    No!
    Make sure to communicate up front to your GM if you have a hard stop time.
    You are in charge of your time.
    We are here to help you optimize it!﻿
- question: >
    What about people with hearing difficulties? How will they know about the last call for tickets?﻿
  tentative_answer: >
    We will have signage and do our best to use them. Holding up signs. I will need to task someone on what our signage options are.
    At a minimum, we should have a poster that we can hold up saying "Last call to get your boarding pass!"
    We are also making a website to convey the procedures. This also is not ideal for those without tech, but we will have a few printouts.﻿
