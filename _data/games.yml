        on board everything starts going wrong. The ship is riddled with alien creatures
        that have killed the crew and turned the Leopold into a nest, a problem compounded
        by the computer core having two A.I.s fighting with each other for control
        of the ship's systems. In a desperate race to survive and escape the situation,
        what starts off as the team's salvation could well turn into their grave.

        you make decisions about the community, decisions that get recorded on a map
        that is constantly evolving. Parts of the map are literal cartography, while
        other parts are symbolic. Players work together to create and steer this community,
        but they also play devil?s advocate and introduce problems and tensions into
        the game.

        game, now translated into English. It is a fantasy role-playing game set in
        a western medieval-style setting. The conceit of this setting is that at one
        point, in everyone?s lives, people get this intense feeling of wanderlust.
        They put their daily lives on hold and travel the world with new-found companions.
        They find out more about the world, and at the same time learn about themselves.
        This is a "feel good" game in the honobono style. It emphasizes travel, exploration,
        community, friendship, harmony and growth. It has a "Console Style" combat
        system and while combat certainly happens, it?s not the central focus of the
        game.

        just have to survive training. Drugs, sleep deprivation, stress all in an
        attempt to break you. This stuff was so locked off you don't even know really
        what your missions will be like but they must be intense. The last set of
        training got weird though, you kept seeing things at the edges of your vision
        and last nights sleep deprivation just about got you to crack. Can't let them
        see you falling apart or you'll wash out. Stay tough and don't talk to the
