# Welcome to Games on Demand's GameDay

This is a [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) powered site.
It leverages [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

## Purpose

I want to provide as much information as is reasonable to various audiences for Games on Demand:

* Hosts - people coordinating matching players with GMs
* GMs - people facilitating games
* Players - people showing up and wanting to play the games

This is to be a tool for those at the convention.

## Installing Jekyll

You will need Ruby installed for this to work.
Once you have that, take a look at [Jekyll's Quick-start guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/).

## Running the Site Offline

From the command line run the following:

```console
$ jekyll serve -p 4000 -H localhost --watch
```

Then point your browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
