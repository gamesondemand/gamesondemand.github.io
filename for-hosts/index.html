    <h3>Hosts should arrive one hour before the boarding starts. Your schedule reflects this.</h3>
    <p><strong>The most critical time for hosting is the 30 minute window surrounding the start of a time slot (e.g. 1:30pm to 2:30pm for the 2pm time slot).</strong></p>

    <h3>Seating Procedure</h3>

    <h4>Before the Slot</h4>
    <p>Hosts organize boarding passes in groups, using only as many as we have capacity to cover for that shift (twelve GMs? 60 passes)</p>

    <p>We can easily hand out more boarding passes if we still have space, but it’s harder to squeeze in pass-holders when there are no seats left.</p>

    <p>Hosts hand out boarding passes in groups (give out all As, then Bs, etc.) so that friends can play together; random sequencing of letter groups matters less than handing them out in groups, because people will want to be able to play together.</p>

    <h4>Slot Start Time</h4>

    <p>At slot start time, give the remaining boarding passes to the <a href="#greeter">Greeter</a> who will be out among the attendees answering questions and helping people.</p>

    <h4>Slot Start Time</h4>

    <p>The other hosts will randomly sort the stack of lettered signs (Z, D, L, etc.) that correspond to the boarding passes. Any letter groups that weren’t included in the original passes should be removed.</p>

    <p>Host <a href="#caller">Caller</a> will begin calling up people by groups, holding the sign up high. As groups make their selections, the lettered sign is attached to the easel so players know what’s been called already.</p>

    <p>Groups could potentially be called up together (“seating B and E”) if having 12 at a time is more efficient.</p>

    <p>The <a href="#handler">Handler</a> hosts will work with the players to make their choices, taking boarding passes and directing them to the appropriate table.</p>

    <p>Late arriving Pass holders with a letter that’s already been called can come up and choose a game (instead of having missed their chance).</p>

  <section id="getting-ready">
    <h3>Getting Ready for the Next Slot</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Get somebody to start sorting the just handed in boarding passes.</li>
      <li>Gather up the just-used game menus.</li>
      <li>From the ticks at the top of the menus, write the expected number of players on the record sheet. Have somebody take the record sheet and go collect tickets.</li>
      <li>Look at the schedule to see if there are any GMs slotted for the next shift who are already at a table. If so, put that menu aside, to keep them at the same table they were just at.</li>
      <li>Erase the player ticks, “X” over any games, and table numbers from all the used menus. (Except for the set-aside ones just mentioned, leave those table numbers, but erase player ticks and “X”s.)</li>
      <li>Put away all the menus that won’t be used in the next shift, alphabetize by first name.</li>
      <li>Gather the new menus for the next slot, based on the GM schedule. Some GMs will have both 2-hour and 4-hour games, so make sure you grab the correct one, based on what they are scheduled for.</li>
      <li>Assign each GM to a table.
        <ul>
          <p><strong>Details on using the table map:</strong></p>
          <li>The table map should indicate the end time that the table is in use until.</li>
          <li>For example, for games starting at 2pm, 2-hour games will last until 4pm, and 4- hour games will last until 6pm. Tables assigned to 2-hour games should have a “4” written next to them, and 4-hour games should have a “6” next to them.</li>
          <li>For any GMs that you are keeping at the same table, update the end time on the table map for their table number.</li>
          <li>Erase any times next to tables that will be done at the start of the next shift, so it’s easy to see what tables will be available for the next slot.</li>
          <li>For example, you are getting ready for the 4pm shift. You’ll erase any “4”s.</li>
          <li>For GMs that don’t have a table number assigned yet, look at the map and find them an empty table. (If possible, tables for games with declared mature content should be further away from tables for all ages.)
            <ul>
              <li>Write the new end time on the table map.</li>
              <li>Write that table number on the GM’s menu page.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>all of the GMs have been assigned a table, record the table numbers and GMs on the record sheet for the next slot. It’s easiest for the ticket collector if you do this in numerical order.
    <li>Put out the menus on the front of the table, for players to see, separated by 2-hour and 4-hour games.</li>
      <li>Determine how many boarding passes to hand out for the next slot, and set aside that many boarding passes.
        <ul>
          <p><strong>Details on boarding pass counts:</strong></p>
          <li>This is based on the minimum maximum number of players for each GM.</li>
          <li>Basically, the boarding pass is a promise there will be room for you to get into a game in the next slot. To make sure this is the case, you look at how many players we could accommodate if every single game that was chosen happened to be each GMs smallest game, but filled to its capacity. So, if a GM has one game that fits 2-4 players, and another game that fits 2-6 players, the minimum maximum for that GM is 4. (If the smallest game is chosen, the one that can fit only up to 4 players, then the maximum players that GM can handle will be 4.)</li>
          <li>So, for all the GMs starting in the next slot, add up each GMs minimum maximum, and that is the number of boarding passes to hand out. To nail this home, here’s an example:
            <pre>
  GM X is offering a 2-4 player game and a 2-6 player game [GM X’s min max is 4]
  GM Y is offering a 1-8 player game and a 4-6 player game [GM Y’s min max is 6]
  GM Z is offering a 3-5 player game and a 4-5 player game [GM Z’s min max is 5]
  So, for this slot, you can hand out 15 (4+6+5) boarding passes.</pre>
          </li>
          <li>Note that this means that most likely there will be more available spots in games than boarding passes we handed out (it would be a big coincidence if every single game chosen was the smallest one). So, even when you run out of boarding passes, encourage interested players to come back at the start of the slot because chances are very good that there will be room for extra players. (Plus some folks won’t return, or will decide they don’t want to play one of the available games after all, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Now is the time to do the final bookkeeping. Add up the total number of expected ticket dollar amounts for 4-hour games and for 2-hour games. Count up these totals in the tickets. Record the amounts on our record sheet, and the Gen Con envelopes. Put tickets in the envelopes and turn them in.</li>
    </li>
  </ol>

<h4>Other General “Chores”</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Find out about available overflow space. Record that information in the Host Bible.</li>
  <li>Walk through the gaming area. Keep it tidy.</li>
  <li>Keep the signage visible and legible.</li>
  <li>Ensure that table numbers are visible.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Host FAQ</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>What should I do if a GM isn’t there?</dt>
      <dd>
        Before you seat anyone at the table, let them know their GM is not yet there.
        It is key to set expectations.
        Perhaps they would want to choose another game?
      </dd>
      <dt>Someone had a great suggestion for how to improve the whole hosting process. Should I do it?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>As a matter of policy and procedure we will not be changing any patron facing interaction of Games on Demand.
        That means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No changes to how boarding passes are handed out.</li>
          <li>When we begin boarding people.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is important because once our patron engages with Games on Demand, we don't want to change things on them. It leads to confusion and customer support distraction.</p>
        It is key to set expectations.
        Perhaps they would want to choose another game?
      </dd>
      <dt>Where do I find out about overflow space?</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>The GM HQ staff will help you find an overflow location.</li>
      </dd>
      <dt>It looks like everyone is here. Can I start boarding early?</dt>
      <dd>No. Expectations have been set. Don't start boarding early.</dd>
