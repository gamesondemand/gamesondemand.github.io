    <h3>Seating Procedure</h3>

    <h4>Before the Slot</h4>
    <p>Hosts organize boarding passes in groups, using only as many as we have capacity to cover for that shift (twelve GMs? 60 passes)</p>

    <p>We can easily hand out more boarding passes if we still have space, but it’s harder to squeeze in pass-holders when there are no seats left.</p>

    <p>Hosts hand out boarding passes in groups (give out all As, then Bs, etc.) so that friends can play together; random sequencing of letter groups matters less than handing them out in groups, because people will want to be able to play together.</p>

    <h4>Slot Start Time</h4>

    <p>At slot start time, give the remaining boarding passes to the <a href="#greeter">Greeter</a> who will be out among the attendees answering questions and helping people.</p>

    <h4>Slot Start Time</h4>

    <p>The other hosts will randomly sort the stack of lettered signs (Z, D, L, etc.) that correspond to the boarding passes. Any letter groups that weren’t included in the original passes should be removed.</p>

    <p>Host <a href="#caller">Caller</a> will begin calling up people by groups, holding the sign up high. As groups make their selections, the lettered sign is attached to the easel so players know what’s been called already.</p>

    <p>Groups could potentially be called up together (“seating B and E”) if having 12 at a time is more efficient.</p>

    <p>The <a href="#handler">Handler</a> hosts will work with the players to make their choices, taking boarding passes and directing them to the appropriate table.</p>

    <p>Late arriving Pass holders with a letter that’s already been called can come up and choose a game (instead of having missed their chance).</p>

    <h3>Host FAQ</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>What should I do if a GM isn’t there?</dt>
      <dd>
        Before you seat anyone at the table, let them know their GM is not yet there.
        It is key to set expectations.
        Perhaps they would want to choose another game?
